I am a former Professor at [Arizona State University](https://ccj.asu.edu) and [Brigham Young University](https://sociology.byu.edu).
The tech industry on the [Silicon Slopes](https://siliconslopes.com) is [booming](https://www.utahbusiness.com/tech-silicon-slopes/) 
so I made the jump to pursue a career in data science. I see the world in terms of research questions, independent and 
dependent variables, cause (more often correlation) and effect. The challenge of sorting out why events occur in a 
multifarious world is what I enjoy most. Accurate prediction is hard, the challenge of doing it well is fun.
