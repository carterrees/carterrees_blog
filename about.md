Data Scientist with 18 years of applied statistical research experience. Extensive experience leading quantitative research
projects and teams from problem conception, data collection, analysis to reporting. Former Professor at 
[Arizona State University](https://ccj.asu.edu) and [Brigham Young University](https://sociology.byu.edu)
and author of 13 peer reviewed [academic journal articles and book chapters](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&authuser=1&user=ippq3CwAAAAJ)
which focus on quantifying and predicting human behavior. The tech industry on the [Silicon Slopes](https://siliconslopes.com) 
is [booming](https://www.utahbusiness.com/tech-silicon-slopes/)  so I made the jump to pursue a career in data science. 
I see the world in terms of research questions, independent and dependent variables, cause (more often correlation) and effect. 
The challenge of sorting out why events occur in a multifarious world is what I enjoy most. Accurate prediction is hard, 
the challenge of doing it well is fun.
